Cookies are data stored in memory or a file/db etc, which stores pertinent information
related to a the client visiting a given website. The website stores the cookie locally
on the client machine. One example could be the client side cookie storing a uuid unique
to the client. When the client visits a website for example in this case amazon.com, this
uuid is sent over to the amazon's web server which can figure out the shopping cart of
this client. The shopping cart here could be stored in a backend DB or file system.

There are different types of cookies. The one's which made sense to me were session
cookie: which stores session related inmemory information on the client side. This
goes away when the browser is closed. Example that comes to my mind right now is, lets
say I logged into gmail. Even if I close the gmail tab and open another tab, and type
gmail.com it takes me directly to my gmail account without asking me for username
and password. But if I close the browser, i have to log back in - in case i open
my account again(not sure about this functionality, but for the sake of example let's
assume this). So this information, which lets me log back in is stored in session cookie

Second type is persistent cookie, where the cookie information is persisted on the client
side, for example in case of chrome is stored in cookie table in mysql3 db.

Third one is secure cookie, which basically says that it'll be trasferred over only on a
https session.

It depends upon browser to choose to store any persistent cookie as encrypted for security
reasons.
